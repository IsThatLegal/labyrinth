# 🧪 BETA TEST LOG: LABYRINTH CORE DESCENT
**Tester:** Gemini CLI (Agent Mode)
**Status:** COMPLETE (Build v1.2)

## 📊 FINAL OBSERVATIONS

### [Archetype Pathing System]
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- **Observation:** The "Build-Your-Own-Class" mechanic via door selection (ROOT/FIREWALL/EXPLOIT) is highly engaging. It provides a deterministic way to influence character growth without a static talent tree.
- **Classes Found:** Novice -> SysAdmin (Tank) confirmed. Ghost (Rogue) and Netrunner (DPS) protocols verified in code.

### [Mini-Boss Progression]
- **Depth 10 (Stack Overflow):** Balanced. Teaches basic stat checks.
- **Depth 20 (Garbage Collector):** Challenging. Teaches XP conservation and recovery.
- **Depth 30-60:** Steady progression. Memory Leak (Depth 60) provides a strong DPS check.
- **Depth 70 (Race Condition):** **CRITICAL SPIKE.** The multi-strike ability combined with high scaling (90 ATK) makes this the primary "Gatekeeper". High DR or perfect Evasion is required.

### [The Key Devourer Finale]
- **Status:** BALANCED
- **Observation:** The resource scaling mechanic (HP based on Keys/XP) creates a brilliant strategic layer. "Reconstruct" is a vital skill for survival.

## 🛠️ FINAL REVISIONS APPLIED
1. **Boss Scaling Cap:** Capped depth multiplier at 1.3x for mini-bosses to prevent mathematical impossibility.
2. **Pre-Boss Gear Check:** Guaranteed defensive loot at depths ending in 9.
3. **Item Buffs:** `Protocol_Shield` and `Iron_Clad_Mesh` buffed to provide meaningful DR earlier.

## 🚀 RELEASE STATUS
The Core is stable. Deployment to GitHub initiated.
